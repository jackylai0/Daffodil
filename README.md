# Daffodil
Daffodil provides native multi-targeting platform toolsets for Visual 
Studio 2010 C++ developers who need to target older versions of Visual 
Studio. Forked from https://daffodil.codeplex.com/

To use these platform toolsets, you must have the targeted version of 
Visual Studio installed. Currently supported platforms are:
- Visual Studio 2005 (VC 8)
- Visual Studio 2003 (VC 7.1)
- Visual Studio 2002 (VC 7)
- Visual Studio 6 (VC 6)

## Visual Studio 2012 or later versions
Daffodil works fine in VS 2012 and later versions as long as Visual Studio 2010 or Visual Studio 2015 is also installed.
If Visual Studio 2010 is installed, install Daffodil with Daffodil.ENU.msi.
If only Visual Studio 2015 is installed, install Daffodil with Daffodil_vs2015.ENU.msi.

It is possible to port the toolsets to specific version of Visual Studio so that Visual Studio 2010 or Visual Studio 2015 is not required.
